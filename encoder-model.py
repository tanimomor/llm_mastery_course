Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual species can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record."

coffee_context = """Coffee is a beverage brewed from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, 
bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its 
caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.[2]

The seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans.
The beans are roasted and then ground into fine particles typically steeped in hot water before 
being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee. It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced 
coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, 
French press, caffÃ¨ latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk, and 
cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.
Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions 
around the Red Sea. The earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage 
appears in modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in Sufi shrines, 
where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to how it is now prepared 
for drinking.[3] The coffee beans were procured by the Yemenis from the Ethiopian Highlands via 
coastal Somali intermediaries, and cultivated in Yemen. By the 16th century, the drink had reached
 the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading to Europe.

The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta.[4] Coffee plants are 
cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast 
Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. As of 2023, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee 
beans, producing 35% of the world's total. Green, unroasted coffee is traded as an agricultural 
commodity. Despite coffee sales reaching billions of dollars worldwide, farmers producing coffee 
beans disproportionately live in poverty. Critics of the coffee industry have also pointed to its 
negative impact on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use. 
The global coffee industry is massive and worth $495.50 billion as of 2023.[5] Brazil, Vietnam, 
and Colombia are the top exporters of coffee beans as of 2023."""
